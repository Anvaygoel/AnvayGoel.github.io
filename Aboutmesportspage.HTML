           		The sport that I love to play is called tennis. It is a really fun sport to 					play. I usually play this sport with most of my friends as they are also very interested in the sport. I play some tournaments 				 for SSV and played USTA once. My coach's name is Ken Malley and he has played in 				  some major open tournaments like Wimbelton. My coach was ranked 90th in the world for singles and 30th in the world for doubles. The racket I use is called the T. 				radical ellitie which is one of the best rackets on the market. The shoes that I 				 wear are the addidas barricade which are alos one of the best shoes out there for tennis.
