       		My favortie sports team is a American football team called the Seattle Seahawks.             I like this team becasue I lived in seattle for 5 years and became a fan of                 them. They have been 3* NFC champions which means that they have been to the                 superbowl 3 times but have only won it once in the 2013-2014 season.                         My favorite player on the team is the Strong-Saftey named Kam Chancellor becasue             he is a hard htting player. Also, their head coach is my favortie and his name               is Pete Caroll. I like him becasue he is a good coach that lets the players be                them selfs on the feild and practice feild. Also, this team is one of the best teams in the NFC which is short for the National Football Conference and have never missed the playoffs in the Pete Caroll era exept in 2011.
