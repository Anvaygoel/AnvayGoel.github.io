       		My favortie sports team is a American football team called the Seattle Seahawks. I like this team 			   becasue I lived in seattle for 5 years and became a fan of them. They have been 3* NFC champions 			   which means that they have been to the superbowl 3 times but have only won it once in the 2013-2014 			   season. My favorite player on the team is the Strong-Saftey named Kam Chancellor becasue he is a hard 			htting player. Also, their head coach is my favortie and his name is Pete Caroll. I like him becasue 			he is a good coach that lets the players be them selfs on the feild and practice feild.
